# Football-Playing-Video-Analysis
This project leverages YOLO, a cutting-edge object detection model, to identify players, referees, and footballs, while also employing trackers to follow these objects across frames. To further improve the performance of the model, we train a custom object detector.Players are then assigned to teams based on the color of their shirts using K-means.
